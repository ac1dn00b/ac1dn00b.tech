So, even though I haven't been posting (which I'm actually planning on doing more often, for real this time) I have been getting back on track.

Since I noticed that the first hurdle I was facing was my lack of understanding of Javascript, I found an online course to fix that. It's really cool to know understand some of the stuff people is talking about when JS comes up. 

I've also been working on my fear of failure and started working on the [Hacker101 CTF](https://ctf.hacker101.com/). Turns out it is really easy when you see how other people solves the problems on YT, but it's a whole different story when you are alone in front of the problem.
