Didn't expect to be back here so soon yet here I am. Installing the certificates took a very short time, including some troubleshooting that was reqired.

First, install certbot and the nginx plugin:

`# pacman -S certbot certbot-nginx`


After that I ran `certbot --nginx` directly, but it failed:

```
# certbot --nginx

Could not automatically find a matching server block for ac1dn00b.tech. Set the 'server_name' directive to use the Nginx installer.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
 - Unable to install the certificate
 - Congratulations! Your certificate and chain have been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/ac1dn00b.tech/fullchain.pem
   Your key file has been saved at:
   /etc/letsencrypt/live/ac1dn00b.tech/privkey.pem
   Your cert will expire on 2020-12-27. To obtain a new or tweaked
   version of this certificate in the future, simply run certbot again
   with the "certonly" option. To non-interactively renew *all* of
   your certificates, run "certbot renew"
 - Your account credentials have been saved in your Certbot
   configuration directory at /etc/letsencrypt. You should make a
   secure backup of this folder now. This configuration directory will
   also contain certificates and private keys obtained by Certbot so
   making regular backups of this folder is ideal.
```
Our problem is here <span style="color:red">`Could not automatically find a matching server block for ac1dn00b.tech. Set the 'server_name' directive to use the Nginx installer.`</span>

In order to solve this we need to change `server_name  localhost;` to `server_name  [your domain];` in the nginx configuration file (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`).

Running the `certbot --nginx` command again should now detect your site and complete successfully:

```
# certbot --nginx

Just in case I restarted nginx with `systemctl restart nginx`, and now the site is properly using https:
