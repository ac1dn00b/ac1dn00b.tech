So here I am, at almost 1am, pretty tired and listening to Amelie Lens, after having just finished reading a writeup (https://www.ezequiel.tech/2020/08/leaking-google-cloud-projects.html). I am using Atom, which I found out about just yesterday, and I'm not going to lie, it just looks like the new cool thing around, so I decided to give it a go, it is not like I have a default text editor, I'm even still getting used to the Gnome Shell after years of being a KDE fan.

And why am I here? Just to create the first post in this blog, which is going to work as a diary in the path that I've decided to walk, one that I expect will lead me to becoming a hacker and bug bounty hunter. This hasn't started tonight, actually it did many months ago, but that story will be for the next post.

The only reason of this first post is to actually exist by itself.
