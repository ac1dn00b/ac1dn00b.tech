This past weekend I decided to dive into this book, something I've been postponing (unbelievable, huh?).

It makes for an awesome read and, having read first "The Web Application Hacker's Manual" I feel this book makes for a better entry point, as it keeps each subject simple enough to understand if you are not an expert in certain technical aspects.

Definitely recommended. You can get it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Bug-Hunting-Field-Hacking-ebook/dp/B072SQZ2LG)
