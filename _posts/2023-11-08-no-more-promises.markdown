So I'm back after a 2 year hiatus.

Not that I've been on a cryogenic chamber asleep, lot's of things have happened in my life in the meantime (I even moved to a new city) but having left this blog completely abandoned and even not renewing my domain ownership is something that somehow was always on the back of my head and I procrastinated a lot bringing it back up.

But well, here we are and with all the stuff that happened during this time I've come back with a different point of view: I'm not going to be declaring how I will be keeping this updated to only turn it into an obligation, taking the fun out of it and then getting frustrated if I "miss an update". This blog should reflect my personal growth and if for any reason I don't have anything to post I don't want to feel guilty, because that's what got my away from blogging the first time.

I do have several post ideas since this last few months I have done a lot of changes on my workflow and I'm more active with bug hunting. Till next time.
