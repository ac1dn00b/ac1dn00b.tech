When I started the site my idea was to keep it regularly updated. Clearly that did not happen.

But well, in the meantime I did do many things, like moving to a new company where I am now on a DevOps role and busy learning the tools of the trade. That even got me programming with Python, something I always wanted to do. I picked up Vagrant, Ansible and even some Terraform along the way these past months. I also went back to KDE, tried Manjaro unsuccessfuly so I decided to stick to doing things manually with Arch.

Anyway, I have a bunch of ideas for the future, things I'd love to do including getting back on track to becoming a Bug Bounty Hunter.
