>The concept of waiting bewilders me. There are always deadlines. There are always ticking clocks. That's why you must manage your time.

Boy, have I procrastinated writing thisâ€¦ In my head, by this time the blog should already have at least four or five posts, yet, I'm only on the second. And that is why I need to start changing the way in which I use Time.

For some reason, most people in general, and me in particular, tend to think that there's plenty of Time to do things later, but unfortunately that not true, I know it's a gloomy thought, but that doesn't make it any less real. Time is the more valuable asset with which we are born, money comes and goes, but time, once you've spent it, it's not coming back.

But, even though this concept has to be present in our mindset in order to avoid wasting this valuable resource, it should not be as something somber to feel constantly threatened by, I've actually known people that has made of this concept almost a religion, and everything was measured based on how to spend Time in the most "useful" way, yet they ended up getting as further away from that goal as they would. Ironic.

So, yes, we must not waste time, not by being obsessed about it, but by incorporating this concept into our lifestyle and workflow. This is something that I also found to be a connecting thread across some of the best hackers out there.

One of the things I've been doing for the most part of this year, in order to get soaked into the bug bounty/hacker culture is watch the Live Recon series, on which Nahamsec (Ben Sadeghipour) interviews hackers. All of them come from different backgrounds, started either very early or not so much, but they all talk about the same thing: if one desires to be successful in this area, there has to be a serious Time investment. Success won't come cheap.

So, I really need to work on my procrastination issue, which has plagued most of my life and sometimes even has me wondering where could I be if I hadn't been doing exactly that for so long. But to cry over past errors would be exactly what I'm trying to avoid, a waste of Time, it would just be another form of procrastination.

Having been able to write this is at least one step forward.

PS: I've registered a site :D
