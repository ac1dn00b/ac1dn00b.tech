The main reason why lately I've been procrastinating hacking was my job. I was working on a project that was my idea and of which I had full ownership to migrate from the current Jenkins pipelines and the code hosting on Github to full CI/CD on Gitlab. As part of the project I had to also move the configuration management from Chef to Ansible.

For that I was spending quite a lot of time learning about both Gitlab and Ansible. I was really keen on seeing that through because I felt it like a great opportunity to grow professionaly, plus it was the first time such a project was an initiative of mine, this time I was not just working on what somebody else was telling me but working on my own project, with my own timeline, setting my own objectives.

And then on Wednesday I was informed that my contract was not renewed and my last day with the account is December 31st, and because of that the Gitlab migration basically did not matter anymore. "Somebody else will figure that out" is what I was told. It was also made very clear that this was not a performance issue on my side, it was just a budgetary issue, there's no money to retain my services with that account and that I will be starting a new selection process to find a new account.

This made me face the fact that I need to start working for myself, I must set my own objectives and not be a pawn of somebody else's will for whom I can become a budgetary issue, an annoying number at any point and get put aside just like that.

Hacking is what I need to focus on, fuck the rest.
